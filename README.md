## 💻 About the project

The "simple" character sheet app for player and GM.
And this application is going to be focused both to be used as a simple character sheet, but you can also use it to transfer character data to [map tools](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool).
For the moment, I will do, for now, for the pathfinder system.
