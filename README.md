## üíª About the project

The "simple" character sheet app for player and GM.
But it was also made to play during a session, where you can manage your character, watch the dice roll on TV.

Just to let you know that the application was designed to play with everyone together in a room, where you have a tv with internet, if you are thinking of using it to play with other people online, unfortunately it won't work, but you can use it. it as character management, that's all.

## üé≤ Usage

On the homepage you have a three way player, gm and tv.

- Player

On the player page, you have the function of managing the playable character.

On the page, there are also two input fields which are the server name and password. For you to connect to a server, there must be an adventure, to create an adventure go to the GM page.

Note: It is possible to connect to the server without the GM being connected.

- GM

On the gm page you have npc, enemy and adventure.

In the same way as on the player page, you can also use the npc or the enemy as a playable character.

On the adventures page, there you will be offered a server name, which you will share with the players.

It also has two buttons that will open a collapse, and within that collapse you can choose the npcs and enemies that will participate in the adventure session.
You may also notice that at the end there is a player slot.
This area is the players that are connected to the server, but if the player is connected, you must click on the open server button to view the players.

- TV

On the tv page, you have two input fields for server name and password.
and in the left corner of the page, is the chat, it will show the results of the dice that were played.

For you to be able to roll a dice, you have to enter the player, npc, enemy or adventures and click on the 'roller' button, which will open a popup/modal, giving you the option to choose the dice and play.
Remember that you have to be connected to the same server for this to work.

Note: It is possible to connect to the server without the GM being connected.

If you have any questions about something, you can contact me.
